# Library-App. See Demo [Here](https://newcastile.github.io/library-app/)
Library App project taken from The Odin Project. The main goal was to grasp to concepts around
objects and constructors. Everything is based in an array of books (objects) created 
by taking the user input, by which we create, delete and update the elements displayed
on the page.

The essential elements are:

- The form, that allows the user to add books.
- The delete button, placed in every book item shown that removes the book in both list.
- The status button, that handles the read status of the book.


## localStorage
This was an optional feature of the page, by adding persistance i learned about
how to work with JSON.parse and JSON.stringify. What JSON stringify does is serialize
an object in a format similar to a JS object literal, and JSON.parse converts 
the data from this format to an object. This two methods made working with localStorage
a bit easier.


## Responsive Design
A personal goal for this project was to build a fresh and clean UI for a better 
user experience. This turned to an obstacule that took a good amount of time to 
overpass, more days than writting the js file actually. Going through Kevin Powell's 
videos really kept me on getting the layout i wanted and also introduced me to 
some interesting concepts and practices on responsive design.
